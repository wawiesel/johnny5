## For you
- Do not introduce optional/defensive branches for data we control. Treat required inputs as required and surface errors when they’re missing.
- Avoid overly specific implementation details that will become outdated.
- Never hack around issues. For installation we're using a venv.
- Whenever you update Markdown, create aligned columns that are easy to read, even though it's not required by Markdown spec.
- Whenever you find something that seems inconsistent, either fix it or point it out. Don't just ignore it.
